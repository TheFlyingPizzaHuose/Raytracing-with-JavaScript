1. Create face to sphere function
 a Find equidistant point between the three points of a face
 b Generate sphere with radius of midpoint distance from face point and center located at midpoint
 c Repeat "a" and "b" for every face in scene
1. Create ray-face intersection fuction
 a Check for intersection of ray with spheres using ray marching
 b Which ever sphere is intersected by the ray, calculate if ray intersects with the sphere's corresponding face.
 c If not repeat "d" until "f" is finished
 g If ray intersects with face, proceed to step 2
2. Create ray bounce function
3. Create keypress-to-movement function
